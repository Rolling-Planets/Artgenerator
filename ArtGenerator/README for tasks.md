We need to: 
— Make proper positioning 
— Load as Gif (at least planets and moons)
— Create animations for other background elements 

— Take useful columns from NASA Exoplanet Archive AND use the Metadata to generate planets. —> http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu

(We could only make the planet itself different for each type of discovered planet, the rest of the elements are still random, according to rarity -> we technically don't know wether the planet has rings or moons because it's too far so it's okay)
Use this: -> https://github.com/ryanvarley/ExoData  if necessary (maybe better than making a json from NASA Excel file)
-> (thay have a function that shows the type of planet from Nasa Exoplanet Database)

— Code storefront: -> https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex
— Make UI+UX/Design of the Homepage (We can use Figma)

Let's see how we divide the tasks
